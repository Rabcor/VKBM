# VKBM
Virtual Keyboard and Mouse program for on-screen keyboard and macro creation purposes on linux. It will be written in C and will utilize the uinput module for virtual device creation.

Version: **Prototyping**

Intended command list:
* key
 * keydown
 * keyup
* mouse
 * mousedown
 * mouseup
 * mousepos
 * mousemove

This is probably the easiest and first program I will actually finish writing. I have a prototype version ready, matter of time before I upload a beta version of it.
